I am currently majoring in software at Gachon University.

I am approaching my dream little by little by learning several programming languages.

My dream is to secure information for any social problem, such as the cyber investigation team.

I know that studying in this field is not easy, but I will try hard and achieve it as it is a dream I have brought for a long time.
